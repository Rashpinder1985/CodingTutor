Subject: New Tool: AI Question Generator for Exit Tickets

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a tool I built that might be useful for you.

It's called "Adaptive Question Generator" and it uses AI to automatically create practice questions based on student exit tickets.

What it does:
- Upload your Google Forms exit ticket results
- Analyzes which concepts students struggled with
- Generates beginner, intermediate, and advanced practice questions
- Download questions immediately for each concept

It's completely free, runs on your computer, and works offline.

GitHub: https://github.com/Rashpinder1985/CodingTutor

Let me know if you try it out!

Best,
[Your Name]
```
