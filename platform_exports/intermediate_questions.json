The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list containing the squares.\",\n  \"code\": \"\"\"\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    squares = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        squares.append(num ** 2)\n        # Subtle bug: incrementing 'i' instead of 'num'\n        i += 1\n    return squares\n  \"\"\",\n  \"task\": \"Identify and fix the subtle bug in the function, then explain why it's causing issues.\",\n  \"solution\": \"\"\"\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    squares = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        squares.append(num ** 2)\n        # Subtle bug: incrementing 'i' instead of 'num'\n        i += 1\n    return squares\n    \"\"\"\n \n  \"explanation\": \"\"\"\nThe issue with the given code is that it tries to use a variable `i` that hasn't been defined anywhere. In Python, you need to define variables before using them.\n \n A better approach would be to use a counter like in this corrected version:\n\ndef square_numbers(numbers):\n    squares = []\n    i = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        squares.append(num ** 2)\n        i += 1\n    return squares,\n\nIn the correct code, 'i' is initialized as a local variable before the loop starts. This way, it can be incremented inside the loop without causing any issues.\n\"\"\",\n  \"expected_output\": \"[[0], [4], [9]]\" \n}\n```",

However, the current implementation starts the loop from 11 (instead of 10), which causes it to skip some values.\nTo fix this, we need to change the `range` function to start at 10 instead of 11. This way, the loop will include all even numbers between 10 and 20 in its output.\"\n}\n```",
