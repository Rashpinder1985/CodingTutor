# Question Mapping Template
# Use this file to map Google Forms questions to concepts and metadata
# This helps the system better understand and categorize questions from exit tickets

# Format:
# "question_text_or_id":
#   concept: "Concept Name"
#   question_type: "MCQ" or "Code" or "Short Answer"
#   course_category: "programming" or "non-programming"
#   programming_language: "python" or "java" or "javascript" or "cpp" (null for non-programming)
