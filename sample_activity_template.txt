Activity Title: Newton's Laws of Motion - Real-World Applications

Activity Description:
Students participated in a hands-on activity to understand Newton's Three Laws of Motion through real-world experiments and demonstrations.

Activity Objectives:
1. Understand and apply Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)
2. Explore Newton's Second Law (F = ma) through practical experiments
3. Demonstrate Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction pairs)

What Students Did:
- Experiment 1: Observed a ball rolling on different surfaces to understand friction and inertia
- Experiment 2: Measured the acceleration of a cart with varying masses and forces
- Experiment 3: Used balloons, skateboards, and springs to demonstrate action-reaction pairs

Key Concepts Covered:
- Inertia and the relationship between mass and resistance to motion
- The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration
- Action-reaction force pairs in everyday situations
- Practical applications of Newton's laws in sports, transportation, and engineering

Expected Learning Outcomes:
- Students should be able to identify and explain Newton's Three Laws
- Students should be able to apply these laws to real-world scenarios
- Students should develop critical thinking about motion and forces in their daily lives
